Case reports on integrated management of tubercular disease. ,"Background Host immunity plays an important role in prevention of disease as is evident by the increased incidence of Tuberculosis (TB) in immuno-compromised population of HIV infected, diabetes inflicted, immune-suppressant therapy and elderly people. Rising incidence of antibiotic resistance has led to resurgence of TB of epidemic proportions. Integrated treatment with add on homeopathy in addition to anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) appears to improve outcome in TB. The intervention has been integrated treatment with homeopathy regime, which is using a patient specific, disease specific and supportive medicine simultaneously, all individualized for the patient and the disease. Cases: Case 1 Pott's spine with paravertebral abscess, not responding to ATT. Addition of homeopathy led to fall in temperature, improved appetite, increase in weight and reduction of abscess. Case 2 Recurrent sub-acute intestinal obstruction. The patient could not tolerate ATT but responded to homeopathy by reduction of abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, loose stools and queasiness. Case 3 Pulmonary TB, treated with both ATT and homeopathy from beginning, led to rapid recovery and shortened treatment time. Conclusion The addition of homeopathy to ATT is patient friendly, cost effective and appears to reduces the duration of treatment. Its role as immuno-modulatory therapy should be evaluated and explored. ",no
Formation and degradation of N-oxide venlafaxine during ozonation and biological post-treatment. ,"While ozonation is considered an efficient treatment to eliminate trace organic compounds (TrOCs) from secondary wastewater effluents, the presence and persistence of transformation products (TPs) resulting from ozonation of TrOCs is a major concern that should be assessed prior to effluent discharge to the environment. Venlafaxine (VLX), an environmentally relevant tertiary amine-containing TrOC, was chosen as the model for this study. TP analysis confirmed that the lone electron pair of the non-protonated amine are the predominant site of oxidant attack, and therefore strongly affected by pH value and VLX speciation. N-oxide VLX (NOV), the primary ozone-induced TP, was formed and degraded simultaneously during ozonation of VLX-containing secondary effluent and reached a maximum yield of 0.44 to 0.85 (NOV-to-VLX(0) ratio), depending on pH and hydroxyl (OH) radical presence. Rate constants for the reaction of NOV with ozone (3.1 Ã— 10(2) M(âˆ’ 1) s(âˆ’ 1)) and OH radicals (5.3 Ã— 10(9) M(âˆ’ 1) s(âˆ’ 1)) were determined. A simple kinetic model was developed to fit the kinetics of formation and degradation of NOV during ozonation in secondary effluents, based on a known ozone-reaction kinetic equation. The biodegradability of NOV (degradation rate of 39%) was significantly lower than that of the parent compound (VLX, 92%) after 71 days, as evaluated by modified Zahn- Wellens tests, suggesting that N-oxide products are not better removed than the parent compound in a simulated biological post-treatment, which may even result in partial reformation of the parent compound. Lessons learned from this study were supported by a pilot-scale demonstration at the Shafdan wastewater-treatment plant, confirming the presence of NOV after ozonation and its persistence in biological post-treatment. Removal of such persistent TP will require higher dosages or promotion of OH-radicals during ozonation. Nevertheless, further assessment of the toxicity of persistent TPs relative to the parent compound is needed for complete evaluation of concerned TPs. ",no
Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture for postoperative pain management in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. ,"Objective To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of Yamamoto New Scalp Acupuncture (YNSA) as an adjuvant for postoperative pain management in cats. Study design Prospective, randomized, blinded, clinical study. Animals Twenty cats aged (mean Â± standard deviation) 25 Â± 9 months and weighing 2.7 Â± 0.6 kg undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Methods The cats were sedated with intramuscular (IM) ketamine (5 mg kg(âˆ’1)), midazolam (0.5 mg kg(âˆ’1)) and tramadol (2 mg kg(âˆ’1)). The cats were randomly distributed before induction of anesthesia into two groups of 10 cats each: group YNSA, in which bilateral basic D points were stimulated with a dry needle from 20 minutes prior to anesthetic induction to the end of the surgery; group Control, in which no acupuncture was applied. Postoperative analgesia was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours postextubation using an Interactive Visual Analog Scale and Universidade Estadual Paulista-Botucatu Multidimensional Composite Pain Scale (UNESP- Botucatu MCPS). Rescue analgesia was provided with IM tramadol (2 mg kg(âˆ’1)), and the pain scores were reassessed 30 minutes after rescue intervention. If the analgesia remained insufficient, meloxicam (0.2 mg kg(âˆ’1) as a single dose) was administered IM. Data were analyzed using Student t-test, Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman test (p < 0.05). Results Significantly lower pain scores were observed in YNSA when compared with Control at 1-4 hours based on the UNESP-Botucatu MCPS scores. Although significant differences were not identified between groups requiring rescue analgesia, additional postoperative analgesia was administered to four of 10 cats in Control and no cats in YNSA. Conclusion and clinical relevance Perioperative YNSA resulted in decreased pain scores and a reduction in postoperative requirement for rescue analgesia in cats. This method should be considered a viable option as an adjuvant analgesic therapy for cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. ",no
A case report of Takayasu arteritis with aortic dissection as initial presentation. ,"Rationale: The initial symptoms and signs of Takayasu arteritis vary due to the heterogeneity of affected vessels. Moreover, the vascular lesions are difficult to detect at initial presentation, making diagnosis even more challenging. Although cases of aortic dissection with arteritis history have been reported, Takayasu arteritis in men with aortic dissection as initial presentation is very rare. Patient concerns: A 37- year-old man presenting with persistent chest and back pain for 6 days was transferred to our hospital for further treatment. Left hand pulse was absent and right lower limb pulse was feeble. Blood pressure was 144/83 mmHg in the right arm but only 114/62 mmHg in the left arm. Diagnoses: Computed tomography angiography revealed aortic dissection (DeBakey type III b) from the descending aorta to the distal abdominal aorta. Interventions: High-dose glucocorticoid therapy and immunosuppressive therapy have been used to control inflammatory reaction during acute period of Takayasu arteritis. Endovascular graft exclusion (EVGE) surgery was performed to cover the primary entry tear and re-expand true lumen during inactive stage. Outcomes: His pain symptoms improved progressively and he was followed in our outpatient clinic after discharged from hospital, without recurrence. Lessons: Timely therapy (glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive) and corrective surgery (endovascular graft exclusion) for Takayasu arteritis with aortic dissection at the inactive stage is essential and beneficial. ",no
Successful Repeat Sacroplasty in a Patient With a Recurrent Sacral Insufficiency Fracture: A Case Presentation. ,"The standard of care for treatment of sacral insufficiency fracture (SIF) remains conservative management with limited weight-bearing and analgesics, as most fractures heal within 12 weeks. For those who fail to respond to conservative therapy, are immobile, or cannot tolerate the pain despite analgesic therapy, as well as those who do not improve with time, rest, or activity modification, minimally invasive surgery with percutaneous transverse screw fixation across the fracture is effective. However, a less invasive procedure, percutaneous sacroplasty, may be an option for potential rapid pain reduction. This is a novel report of repeat sacroplasty in a patient with a recurrent SIF to the same anatomical area as a previously treated SIF. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an occurrence. Level of Evidence Not applicable. ",no
Recommendations for the use of oral treprostinil in clinical practice: A delphi consensus project pulmonary circulation. ,"Oral treprostinil was recently labeled for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similar to the period immediately after parenteral treprostinil was approved, there is a significant knowledge gap for practicing physicians who might prescribe oral treprostinil. Despite its oral route of delivery, use of the drug is challenging because of the requirement for careful titration and management of drug- related adverse effects. We aimed to create a consensus document combining available evidence with expert opinion to provide guidance for use of oral treprostinil. Following a methodology commonly used in business and social sciences (the Delphi Process), two investigators from the oral treprostinil (Freedom) studies created a series of statements based on available evidence and the package insert. The set of best practice statements was circulated to nine other Freedom trial investigators. Their comments were incorporated into the document as new line items for further vote and comment. The subsequent document was put to vote line by line (scale of -5 to +5) and a final statement was drafted. Consensus recommendations include initial therapy with 0.125 mg for treatment nayÂ¨ve patients, three times daily dosing, aggressive use of antidiarrheal medication, and a strong preference for use of the drug in combination with other approved PAH therapies. This process was particularly valuable in providing guidance for the management of adverse events (where essentially no data is available). The Delphi process was useful to codify investigator experience and subsequently develop investigator consensus about practical issues for physicians who may wish to prescribe oral treprostinil. ",no
Efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine patch on post-operative pain relief after elective spinal instrumentation surgery. ,"Background and Aims: Transdermal buprenorphine patch (TDB) is increasingly used for chronic pain management because of non-invasive dosing, longer duration of action and minimal side effects. However its role in acute post-operative pain management for spinal instrumentation surgery is not well established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine patch for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing spinal instrumentation surgery. Methods: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, prospective study, 70 adult patients undergoing elective spinal instrumentation surgery were randomly allocated into two groups-TDB Group (buprenorphinepatch) and TDP Group (placebo patch). Time to first rescue analgesic requirement was the primary outcome. All patients also were monitored for total rescue analgesic requirement, drug-related adverse effect and haemodynamic status till 48 h after surgery. Statistical analysis was carried out using student independent t-test if normally distributed or with Mann-Whitney U-test if otherwise. Results: Time to first post-operative rescue analgesic (tramadol) requirement was much delayed in TDB Group than TDP Group (708.0 Â±6.98 min vs 54 Â± 0.68 min, P < 0.001) and the total tramadol requirement was higher in TDB Group (490.60 Â± 63.09 averagevs. 162.93 Â± 63.91 mg, P < 0.001). Intra-and post-operative haemodynamic status was also stable in TDB Group without any adverse event. Conclusion: A TDB patch (10 Âµg/hour) applied 24 hours before surgery can be used as a postoperative analgesic for lumber fixation surgery without any drug-related adverse effect. ",no
Effect of dexmedetomidine infusion for intravenous patientcontrolled analgesia on the quality of recovery after laparotomy surgery. ,"Background: The Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) is a patient-centered questionnaire to evaluate the recovery after surgery and anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine has sedative, analgesic, antiinflammatory and inhibitory sympathetic effects, which may contribute to early recovery. We hypothesized dexmedetomidine added to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) could enhance the quality of recovery (QoR) in patients undergoing laparotomy surgery. Methods: In this randomized, double- blind, controlled study, 100 patients undergoing laparotomy surgery were randomly allocated into two groups: Dexmedetomidine (group D) and control (group S). Patients in the group D (n = 46) received dexmedetomidine 0.04 ug/(kgÂ·h) plus sufentanil 0.02 ug/(kgÂ·h) for 48 h after laparotomy surgery, and in the group S (n = 47) received sufentanil 0.04 ug/ (kgÂ·h) only. The QoR-15 scores, postoperative pain, rescue analgesia, recovery of gastrointestinal function, patient satisfaction and adverse effects were recorded. Results: The QoR-15 scores were significantly higher in the group D than in the group S on postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, 3 and 5 (P < 0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were significantly lower in the group D compared with group S within 48 h after surgery (P < 0.05). The pressing times of analgesic pump and rescue tramadol were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). The incidence of nausea was significantly lower in the Group D. No hypotension, bradycardia, or respiratory depression was observed. Conclusions: The addition of dexmedetomidine to PCA enhanced patient-centered recovery, reduced pain and adverse effect, and improved patient satisfaction after laparotomy surgery. ",no
Cardiovascular effects and intraoperative pharmacokinetics of tramadol in sheep undergoing spinal surgery. ,"Objective To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of two doses of tramadol during isoflurane anaesthesia in sheep and their ability to prevent the cardiovascular response induced by surgical stimulation. Study design Prospective randomized controlled study. Animals A total of 12 healthy sheep (mean weight, 47.5 Â± 7.9 kg) undergoing lumbar transpedicular intervertebral disk nucleotomy. Methods Sheep were sedated with medetomidine, anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane at 1.5 vol.%. Baseline heart rate and blood pressure were measured and sheep were randomly assigned an intravenous injection of tramadol (4 or 6 mg kg(âˆ’1)). Fentanyl was injected as rescue analgesic if cardiovascular parameters were increased more than 20% compared to baseline. If those variables were below 20% of baseline, the concentration of isoflurane was gradually decreased until parameters returned to the original value. Blood collections were performed at pre- assigned times, and concentrations of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol (M1) assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results Time from premedication to anaesthesia induction, anaesthesia time, propofol dose and intraoperative body temperature were similar between doses. Cardiovascular variables remained between Â±20% of baseline value, and no statistical difference was observed between treatments. Regardless of the dose of tramadol administered, arterial blood pressure was statistically higher than baseline 10 minutes after tramadol administration, but it gradually returned to previous values. A two- compartment model and a non-compartment model described the pharmacokinetics of tramadol and M1, respectively. Plasma concentrations of tramadol rapidly decreased in the first 2 hours for both doses with an elimination half-life of more than 40 minutes. The M1 maximum concentration was similar for both doses, and it was detected in plasma after 35 minutes. Conclusions and clinical relevance Both doses of tramadol provided adequate cardiovascular stability during spinal surgery in sheep. The pharmacokinetic variables may be used to plan the dosage regime during general anaesthesia. ",yes
"Recent advances in acute pain management: Understanding the mechanisms of acute pain, the prescription of opioids, and the role of multimodal pain therapy. ","In this review, we discuss advances in acute pain management, including the recent report of the joint American Pain Society and American Academy of Pain Medicine task force on the classification of acute pain, the role of psychosocial factors, multimodal pain management, new non- opioid therapy, and the effect of the ""opioid epidemic"". In this regard, we propose that a fundamental principle in acute pain management is identifying patients who are most at risk and providing an ""opioid free anesthesia and postoperative analgesia"". This can be achieved by using a multimodal approach that includes regional anesthesia and minimizing the dose and the duration of opioid prescription. This allows prescribing medications that work through different mechanisms. We shall also look at the recent pharmacologic and treatment advances made in acute pain and regional anesthesia. ",yes
Deaths from Opioid Overdosing: Implications of Coroners Inquest Reports 2008-2012 and Annual Rise in Opioid Prescription Rates: A Population- Based Cohort Study. ,"Introduction: In the late 1990s multiple physicians and advocacy organizations promoted increased use of opioids for the treatment of acute, chronic and cancer pain. There has been an exponential growth in opioid prescribing in the last 20 years in the United States of America, in Australia, and in other developed Western countries. There are negative consequences associated with the liberal use of opioids. The primary aim of this population-based cohort study is to investigate the opioid-related death rate in New Zealand between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012. The secondary aims of this cohort study are: (1) to compare the opioid-related death rate per population in New Zealand in 2001/2002 with that between 2011/2012; (2) to investigate the number of opioid prescriptions in New Zealand between 2001 and 2012; (3) to compare the opioid-related death rate per population in New Zealand between 2001 and 2012 with the number of opioid prescriptions in New Zealand between 2001 and 2012. Methods: Permission to access records from the Coronial Services Office in Wellington for 2008-2012 was acquired. Permission to access records for prescriptions containing opioids (dose and formulation) was obtained from the Pharmaceutical Collection. Results: The rate of opioid-related deaths in New Zealand has increased by 33% from 2001 to 2012. More than half of the opioid- related deaths between 2008 and 2012 were unintentional opioid overdoses. Opioid analgesic deaths were most likely due to methadone, morphine and codeine prescribed by healthcare professionals. That 179 of these opioid-related deaths between 2008 and 2012 were unintentional opioid overdoses, and thus could have been avoided, is tragic. This study shows that there was a steady annual increases in opioid prescriptions in New Zealand from 2001 to 2012. This rise in opioid analgesic deaths was associated with the increases in the numbers of opioid prescriptions. Conclusion: A multifaceted national public health approach is needed to bring together the various stakeholders involved with pain management, opioid dependence, opioid availability and opioid diversion. There needs to be a targeted approach to educate current and future medical practitioners regarding the appropriate use of opioid prescriptions for the management of pain, as well as a strengthening of primary, secondary and tertiary resources to support medical practitioners managing their patients who suffer with pain. ",yes
Effets indesirables Â« graves Â» du tramadol: bilan 2011-2015 de pharmacovigilance en France. ,"Background Tramadol is an opioid and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug. It is approved for moderate to severe pain in adults. The aim of this study was to assess tramadol safety through a national pharmacovigilance study in France since dextropropoxyphen withdrawal in 2011. Methods We described all serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) reported with tramadol in adults in the French National PharmacoVigilance Database from August 1st, 2011 to December 31st, 2015. Results We identified 1512 SADRs during the study period. The most frequently reported SADRs were neurological (29.4%, including troubles of consciousness [13.2%] and seizures [6.7%]), psychiatric (22.8%, including confusions [14.6%] and hallucinations [7.3%]) and gastrointestinal (17.0%, mostly nausea and vomiting [9.6%]). Unexpected SADRs were also reported: hyponatremia, cholestatic hepatitis, serotonin syndrome. Conclusions This study demonstrates new unexpected hepatic and metabolic SADRs. Tramadol alone can induce serotonin syndrome in overdose situations. ",yes
Evaluation of tramadol in osteoarthritic geriatric cats. ,"Introduction: Tramadol multimodal mechanisms of action may be useful in managing feline osteoarthritis pain. The goal was to evaluate tramadol administration on impaired mobility as surrogate for pain relief in geriatric osteoarthritic cats. Methods: Using a blinded, balanced Latin square design, 24 otherwise healthy client-owned geriatric (â‰¥10 years- old) cats with owner-identified mobility impairment, and clinical and radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis in at least one appendicular joint were studied. Cats received 0 (placebo), 1, 2 and 4 mg kg(-1) tramadol orally twice daily during 5 days with a two-day (weekend) washout between treatments. Responses to treatments were assessed with a collar-mounted activity monitor system and a client-specific outcome measure (CSOM) questionnaire. Activity data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post-tests, CSOM data with Friedman test and Dunn's post-test, complication rate with chi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results: Activity increased significantly with 2 mg kg(-1) tramadol compared to placebo. Significantly more owners considered their cats improved (61%) with the 2 mg kg(-1) treatment compared to all others (33-38%). Most owners (85%) considered their cat's global quality of life improved during the study. Adverse events (euphoria, dysphoria, sedation, decreased appetite and diarrhea) were significantly more frequent with 4 mg kg(-1) (42%) and 2 mg kg(-1) (33%) but not with 1 mg kg(-1) (9.5%) treatments compared to placebo (0%). Conclusion: Tramadol 2 mg kg(-1) modestly improved previously impaired mobility of geriatric cats with osteoarthritis. Dose refinement may be necessary in individual cats to balance efficacy and tolerability. ",yes
Tramadol effects on physical performance and sustained attention during a 20-min indoor cycling time-trial: A randomised controlled trial. ,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of tramadol on performance during a 20-min cycling time-trial (Experiment 1), and to test whether sustained attention would be impaired during cycling after tramadol intake (Experiment 2). DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. METHODS: In Experiment 1, participants completed a cycling time-trial, 120-min after they ingested either tramadol or placebo. In Experiment 2, participants performed a visual oddball task during the time-trial. Electroencephalography measures (EEG) were recorded throughout the session. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, average time- trial power output was higher in the tramadol vs. placebo condition (tramadol: 220W vs. placebo: 209W; p<0.01). In Experiment 2, no differences between conditions were observed in the average power output (tramadol: 234W vs. placebo: 230W; p>0.05). No behavioural differences were found between conditions in the oddball task. Crucially, the time frequency analysis in Experiment 2 revealed an overall lower target- locked power in the beta-band (p<0.01), and higher alpha suppression (p<0.01) in the tramadol vs. placebo condition. At baseline, EEG power spectrum was higher under tramadol than under placebo in Experiment 1 while the reverse was true for Experiment 2. CONCLUSIONS: Tramadol improved cycling power output in Experiment 1, but not in Experiment 2, which may be due to the simultaneous performance of a cognitive task. Interestingly enough, the EEG data in Experiment 2 pointed to an impact of tramadol on stimulus processing related to sustained attention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT number: 2015-005056-96.
