Single-dose pharmacokinetics of co-crystal of tramadol-celecoxib: Results of a four-way randomized open-label phase I clinical trial in healthy subjects. ,"Aims: Co-crystal of tramadol-celecoxib (CTC) is a novel co-crystal molecule containing two active pharmaceutical ingredients under development by Esteve (E-58425) and Mundipharma Research (MR308). This Phase I study compared single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of CTC with those of the individual reference products [immediate-release (IR) tramadol and celecoxib] alone and in open combination. Methods: Healthy adults aged 18-55Â years were orally administered four treatments under fasted conditions (separated by 7-day wash-out period): 200Â mg IR CTC (equivalent to 88Â mg tramadol and 112Â mg celecoxib; Treatment 1); 100Â mg IR tramadol (Treatment 2); 100Â mg celecoxib (Treatment 3); and 100Â mg IR tramadol and 100Â mg celecoxib (Treatment 4). Treatment sequence was assigned using computer-generated randomization. PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis with parameters for CTC adjusted according to reference product dose (100Â mg). Results: Thirty-six subjects (28 male, mean age 36Â years) participated. Tramadol PK parameters for Treatments-1, -2 and -4, respectively, were 263, 346 and 349Â ng ml(-1) (mean maximum plasma concentration); 3039, 2979 and 3119Â ng h ml(-1) (mean cumulative area under the plasma concentration-time curve); and 2.7, 1.8 and 1.8Â h (median time to maximum plasma concentration). For Treatments 1, 3 and 4, the respective celecoxib PK parameters were 313, 449 and 284Â ng ml(- 1); 2183, 3093 and 2856Â ng h ml(-1); and 1.5, 2.3 and 3.0Â h. No unexpected adverse events were reported. Conclusion: PK parameters of each API in CTC were modified by co-crystallization compared with marketed formulations of tramadol, celecoxib, and their open combination. ",no
Perioperative pregabalin administration does not prevent chronic postoperative pain: Systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomized trials. ,"The efficacy of perioperative pregabalin treatment for preventing chronic pain remains a matter of debate. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Cochrane, and Clinical Trial Register databases, and other sources, for randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of pregabalin and placebo. The primary outcome was the incidence of chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) at 3 months. The secondary endpoints were CPSP at 3, 6, and 12 months and the incidence of chronic postsurgical neuropathic pain at the same time points. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed on the combined data. Evidence quality was rated by the GRADE method. We included 18 studies (2485 patients) in the meta- analysis. Overall, 60% of the trials reporting the primary outcome at 3 months were unpublished; the unpublished trials corresponded to 1492/ 1884 (79%) of the patients included in these studies. No difference in CPSP incidence between pregabalin and placebo was found at any time point; the risk ratio was 0.87 (0.66, 1.14), I 2 = 57% at 3 months. The evidence was considered to be of moderate quality. Subgroup analysis by publication status, daily dose, type of administration, and type of surgery did not highlight any differences between subgroups. Insufficient data concerning the incidence of chronic postsurgical neuropathic pain were available for any firm recommendation to be made. Pooled data from published and unpublished studies provide no support for the efficacy of pregabalin for preventing CPSP. ",no
The assessment of surgical and non-surgical treatment of stage II medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. ,"Background: Non-surgical treatment has generally been recommended for stage II medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in preference to surgery. However, non-surgical treatment is not empirically effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether surgical or non-surgical treatment leads to better outcomes for stage II MRONJ. Material and Methods: In this retrospective study, surgery was performed in a total of 28 patients while 24 patients underwent non- surgical treatment. The outcomes of both treatment approaches after 6 months were evaluated and statistically compared. In addition, risk factors for surgical and non-surgical treatments were assessed for each. Results: Surgical treatment in 25 patients (89.3%) resulted in success, with failure in 3 patients (10.7%). Nonsurgical treatment was successful for 8 patients (33.3%) and failed in 16 patients (66.7%). There was therefore a significant difference between surgical and non-surgical treatment outcomes (P<0.01). Regarding risk factors, in non-surgical treatment primary diseases, medications, and drug holiday had a significant effect on outcomes (P<0.01). Risk factors for surgical treatment could not be clarified. Conclusions: Surgical treatment is more effective than non-surgical treatment for stage II MRONJ, and drug holiday, primary disease, and medication constitute risk factors in non- surgical treatment. ",no
Patient perspectives on peripheral neuropathic pain experience within the community. ,"Purpose of this cross-sectional study was to explore the relationship between neuropathic physical complaints (NPC) and quality-of-life (QoL) in community-dwelling patients with diabetes in Broward County, Florida. Adult patients were invited to complete a 10-minute paper questionnaire at a community hospital between October 2014-April 2016. Analysis of data from 124 participants (60 with distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSPN) diagnosis versus 64 without DSPN diagnosis) with NPC, showed those with DSPN had a longer duration of diabetes, suffered a higher number of NPC, and had a lower QoL (all pâ‰¤0.001) with more impediments to performing daily activities. While differences in pain severity and QoL were present in patients with DSPN versus those without DSPN diagnosis, NPC were still reported by those without DSPN diagnosis. Healthcare providers are encouraged to identify possible NPC during earlier stages of glycemic dysregulation and address foot care issues promptly to mitigate the disease's effect on QoL. ",no
The use of analgesic drugs in patients with sickle cell painful crisis. ,"Objective: To determine the drug options used for pain in patients with acute sickle cell painful crisis at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI), Jamaica. Method: This retrospective study assessed all patients admitted to the UHWI between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010, with acute sickle cell anaemia painful crisis and the data obtained regarding site, severity, outcome and drug options selected for pain. Results: There were 101 patients with a mean age (Â± SD) of 18.6 (Â± 14.3) years; there was no difference in gender (42 females, 59 males). Eight sites of pain were reported, with the most common site being the lower limbs (44.6%) and 60.3% experienced pain in more than one site. Most of the patients (75.2%) were diagnosed with severe pain. Drug options included opioid, non-opioid or a combination, with pethidine (76) and paracetamol (79) being the most common chosen opioid and non-opioid drugs selected for therapy. There was low correlation between pain severity and appropriate first-line treatment (Spearman's rho = 0.344; p < 0.000). All patients with ""mild"" and ""mild to moderate"" pain were initially treated and obtained resolution of pain with non- opioid based therapy. However, most of the patients with severe pain (55.3%) required a second-line and some third line (14.5%) of therapy for resolution at the time of discharge from the hospital. Conclusion: Painful crisis in patients with sickle cell anaemia is associated with severe pain in 75% and most will require second-line therapy for adequate resolution. Physicians need to provide adequate pain relief to decrease morbidity in these patients. ",no
A review of Neuropathic Pain: From Guidelines to Clinical Practice. ,"Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition representing a significant burden for patients, society, and healthcare systems. The prevalence of neuropathic pain in the general population has been estimated at 7-8% and is expected to increase in the future. Neuropathic pain differs from nociceptive pain and requires a different therapeutic approach; and the management of neuropathic pain is complicated and challenging. This chapter discusses clinical practice guidelines for neuropathic pain and their usefulness in clinical practice. Funding: Pfizer, Italy. ",no
Stability-indicating RP-HPLC method for simultaneous quantitation of tramadol and aceclofenac in presence of their major degradation products: Method development and validation. ,"Primary objective of this study was to develop a stability-indicating reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for simultaneous quantitation of tramadol and aceclofenac in presence of their degradation products. The drugs were subjected to various International Conference on Harmonization recommended stress conditions, such as acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis, peroxide oxidation, thermolysis, and photolysis. The major degradation products got well resoluted from the analytes in HPLC analysis with a mobile phase composed of a mixture of 0.01 M ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and acetonitrile (65:35, v/v) through a Phenomenex Gemini C18 (250 mm Ã— 4.6 mm, 5 Âµm particle size) column. The method was linear over a range of 15-60 Âµg/mL for tramadol and 40-160 Âµg/mL for aceclofenac concentration. The analytes were detected at a wavelength of 270 nm. The method was validated and found to be specific, accurate, precise, stable, and robust for its intended use. The method can be recommended for its future use in routine quality control, accelerated and real-time stability analysis of the formulations containing tramadol and aceclofenac combination. ",no
Dexamethasone and Dexmedetomidine as an Adjuvant to Intraarticular Bupivacaine for Postoperative Pain Relief in Knee Arthroscopic Surgery: A Randomized Trial. ,"BACKGROUND: Knee arthroscopy causes minimal trauma, however, good analgesia is required for early rehabilitation and return to normal life in the patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the analgesic effects of intraarticular dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine with those of bupivacaine alone. STUDY DESIGN: This study uses a double- blind, randomized, controlled design with allocation concealment in a 3- armed parallel group format among patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscal surgery. SETTING: The study was conducted at Assiut University Hospital in Asyut, Egypt. The study duration was from July 2016 to February 2017. METHODS: After the ethics committee approval, 60 patients, with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I or II, 20 - 50 years old, and scheduled for arthroscopic meniscal surgery were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive 18 mL intraarticular bupivacaine 0.25% with either dexamethasone 8 mg (group I), dexmedetomidine 1 ug/kg (group II), or 2 mL of normal saline (group III). The total volume of injectate used in each group was 20 mL. All of the patients received spinal anesthesia. Postoperatively, oral paracetamol 1000 mg was given every 8 hours, and oral tramadol 50 mg was administered, as needed, for rescue analgesia. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, time to first analgesic request, and total dose of postoperative analgesics were recorded for 3 days postoperatively. RESULTS: The VAS scores were lower in groups I and II compared with group III. The time to the first analgesic was significantly shorter in group III compared with groups I and II (P = 0.001). The total dose of rescue paracetamol was higher in group III compared with groups I and II (P = 0.001). No need for tramadol rescue analgesia was recorded in any of the groups. No significant differences between groups I and II were noticed. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of this study include the lack of previous research to compare the effect of both intraarticular dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia in arthroscopic knee surgery. Additionally, there was a short observation period for the detection of chondrotoxicity, if occurred. CONCLUSION: The addition of dexamethasone or dexmedetomidine to a solution of bupivacaine 0.25% provided better analgesia than using bupivacaine alone. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02818985. KEY WORDS: Intraarticular, knee arthroscopy, bupivacaine, dexmedetomidine, dexamethasone, postoperative pain. ",no
Tapentadol versus tramadol in the management of low back pain in the emergency department. ,"Nontraumatic musculoskeletal disorders are the main reason for presentation to the emergency department (ED), with rachialgia (back pain) being the most common reason to request medical assessment among them. This also generates the highest demand for reassessments due to poor pain control or onset of adverse reactions to the treatment prescribed in the initial assessment. A retrospective observational study based on usual clinical practice was conducted in patients attending the ED due to low back pain during a period of 24 months. The primary objective was to determine the demand for reassessments in the ED by these patients in the following 30 days, according to the type of therapeutic approach used in the initial assessment. A total of 732 patients who requested medical assessment due to back pain in the ED of our hospital were analyzed, 91 of whom were treated with tapentadol whereas 641 received another treatment. In the first month after the initial assessment, reassessments were less common in the tapentadol group; this difference was significant from days 8 to 15 (P = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] 0.252 with 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.100-0.635) and days 15 to 30 (P < 10 -4, OR 0.277 with 95% CI 0.136-0.563). Patients who received tapentadol also had a better clinical evolution of pain compared to those who did not receive it (P < 10 -4) and to those who received tramadol (P < 10 -4). In this study in patients with back pain, tapentadol shows clear advantages over the other analgesics analyzed, in terms of pain control and less need for reassessments. ",no
Systematic assessment of different solvents for the extraction of drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals from an authentic hair pool. ,"Hair analysis has been established as a prevalent tool for retrospective drug monitoring. In this study, different extraction solvents for the determination of drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals in hair were evaluated for their efficiency. A pool of authentic hair from drug users was used for extraction experiments. Hair was pulverized and extracted in triplicate with seven different solvents in a one- or two-step extraction. Three one- (methanol, acetonitrile, and acetonitrile/water) and four two-step extractions (methanol two-fold, methanol and methanol/ acetonitrile/formate buffer, methanol and methanol/formate buffer, and methanol and methanol/hydrochloric acid) were tested under accurately equal experimental conditions. The extracts were directly analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for opiates/opioids, stimulants, ketamine, selected benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antihistamines using deuterated internal standards. For most analytes, a two-step extraction with methanol did not significantly improve the yield compared to a one-step extraction with methanol. Extraction with acetonitrile alone was least efficient for most analytes. Extraction yields of acetonitrile/water, methanol and methanol/acetonitrile/formate buffer, and methanol and methanol/formate buffer were significantly higher compared to methanol. Highest efficiencies were obtained by a two-step extraction with methanol and methanol/hydrochloric acid, particularly for morphine, 6- monoacetylmorphine, codeine, 6-acetylcodeine, MDMA, zopiclone, zolpidem, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, citalopram, and doxylamine. For some analytes (e.g., tramadol, fluoxetine, sertraline), all extraction solvents, except for acetonitrile, were comparably efficient. There was no significant correlation between extraction efficiency with an acidic solvent and the pka or log P of the analyte. However, there was a significant trend for the extraction efficiency with acetonitrile to the log P of the analyte. The study demonstrates that the choice of extraction solvent has a strong impact on hair analysis outcomes. Therefore, validation protocols should include the evaluation of extraction efficiency of drugs by using authentic rather than spiked hair. Different extraction procedures may contribute to the scatter of quantitative results in inter-laboratory comparisons. Harmonization of extraction protocols is recommended, when interpretation is based on same cut-off levels. ",no
Applications of molecularly imprinted polymers for solid-phase extraction of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics from environmental waters and biological samples. ,"The occurrence of pharmaceuticals used as non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics in the aquatic environment is a threat to humans and aquatic species at large. The primary route of these pharmaceuticals to aquatic environment is through human waste such as urine and faeces. The application of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) in the solid-phase extraction (SPE) of such pollutants from environmental and biological samples is important for the pre- concentration of compounds and selectivity of the analytical methods. To date, there are still limited commercial suppliers of MIPs. However, it is easy to synthesize such polymers via non-covalent imprinting approach using easily available and affordable reagents. Therefore, the applications of MIPs in the SPE of NSAIDs and analgesics from environmental and biological samples are reviewed. This is very important because despite the fact that review articles on applications of MIPs for organic compounds have been reported, very little has focussed on NSAIDs and analgesics which are the major studied pharmaceuticals in the environment and biological samples. The review also brings out important aspects of common reagents used including the template molecules during MIP synthesis. Application and future trends are also discussed. Gaps such as little use of environmental friendly reagents such as ionic liquids have been identified. Also, the lack of MIP applications to some compounds such as fenoprofen has been observed which is likely to be developed in the near future. ",no
Influence of two administration rates of propofol at induction of anaesthesia on its relative potency in cats: a pilot study. ,"Objectives: This was a randomised, blinded trial to investigate the influence of administration rate on the dose of propofol required for the orotracheal intubation of cats. Methods: Twenty-four female domestic cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy were premedicated with oral tramadol (6 mg/kg) or intramuscular tramadol (4 mg/kg), and intramuscular dexmedetomidine (0.007 mg/kg). Oral or intramuscular (IM) tramadol was administered 60 or 30 mins prior to induction of anaesthesia, respectively. Dexmedetomidine was administered 30 mins prior to anaesthetic induction. Sedation scores were established prior to anaesthesia induction with propofol intravenously at 4 mg/kg/min (fast) or 1 mg/kg/min (slow) to effect until orotracheal intubation was achieved without coughing. If coughing occurred, the intubation process was paused for 15 s. Four groups were determined: IM tramadol/propofol fast (GIMF, n = 6); IM tramadol/propofol slow (GIMS, n = 6); oral tramadol/propofol fast (GOF, n = 6); oral tramadol/propofol slow (GOS, n = 6). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate for normality of residuals. Sedation scores and propofol anaesthetic induction doses were compared between GIMF and GIMS groups, and between GOF and GOS groups using the Mann-Whitney test and the t-test, respectively (P = 0.05). The presence of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure <60 mmHg) or apnoea (no breathing for 30 s or more) within the first 15 mins postintubation was recorded. Results: The median sedation scores for GIMF and GOF were not significantly different compared with those for GIMS (P = 0.94) and GOS (P = 0.70). However, the mean Â± SD propofol anaesthetic induction doses were higher in GIMF (9.1 Â± 1.8 mg/kg) and GOF (7.9 Â± 1.7 mg/kg) than in GIMS (5.1 Â± 1.5 mg/kg; P <0.01) and GOS (5.4 Â± 0.3 mg/kg; P <0.01). No hypotension or apnoea were detected. Conclusions and relevance: Using the slower anaesthetic induction rate resulted in an increase in propofol relative potency. ",no
Central hypoventilation syndrome and hypoxic drive disorder. ,The central hypoventilation syndrome is a rare disease which is mainly characterized by respiratory failure in response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.

Pain Management Strategies in Shoulder Arthroplasty. ,"Pain control in total shoulder arthroplasty demands a multidisciplinary approach with collaboration between patients, surgeon, and anesthetist. A multimodal approach with preemptive medication, regional blockade, local anesthetics, and a combination of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, tramadol, and gabapentinoids postoperatively leads to pain control and patient satisfaction. Assessment of patients' expectations constitutes a vital aspect of the preoperative patient evaluation. Educating and psychologically preparing patients reduces postoperative pain. Patients with anxiety and depression, preoperative narcotic use, and medical comorbidities are at an increased risk for suboptimal pain control. Minimizing narcotic use decreases opioid- related adverse effects and facilitates productive rehabilitation efforts. CI - Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ",no
Pain and Its Control in Reptiles. ,Reptiles have the anatomic and physiologic structures needed to detect and perceive pain. Reptiles are capable of demonstrating painful behaviors. Most of the available literature indicates pure m-opioid receptor agonists are best to provide analgesia in reptiles. Multimodal analgesia should be practiced with every reptile patient when pain is anticipated. Further research is needed using different pain models to evaluate analgesic efficacy across reptile orders. ,no
Risk-adapted monitoring is not inferior to extensive on-site monitoring: Results of the ADAMON cluster-randomised study. ,"Background: According to Good Clinical Practice, clinical trials must protect rights and safety of patients and make sure that the trial results are valid and interpretable. Monitoring on-site has an important role in achieving these objectives; it controls trial conduct at trial sites and informs the sponsor on systematic problems. In the past, extensive on-site monitoring with a particular focus on formal source data verification often lost sight of systematic problems in study procedures that endanger Good Clinical Practice objectives. ADAMON is a prospective, stratified, cluster-randomised, controlled study comparing extensive on-site monitoring with risk-adapted monitoring according to a previously published approach. Methods: In all, 213 sites from 11 academic trials were cluster-randomised between extensive on-site monitoring (104) and risk-adapted monitoring (109). Independent post- trial audits using structured manuals were performed to determine the frequency of major Good Clinical Practice findings at the patient level. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of audited patients with at least one major audit finding. Analysis relies on logistic regression incorporating trial and monitoring arm as fixed effects and site as random effect. The hypothesis was that risk-adapted monitoring is non- inferior to extensive on-site monitoring with a non-inferiority margin of 0.60 (logit scale). Results: Average number of monitoring visits and time spent on-site was 2.1 and 2.7 times higher in extensive on-site monitoring than in risk-adapted monitoring, respectively. A total of 156 (extensive on-site monitoring: 76; risk-adapted monitoring: 80) sites were audited. In 996 of 1618 audited patients, a total of 2456 major audit findings were documented. Depending on the trial, findings were identified in 18%-99% of the audited patients, with no marked monitoring effect in any of the trials. The estimated monitoring effect is âˆ’0.04 on the logit scale with two-sided 95% confidence interval (âˆ’0.40; 0.33), demonstrating that risk-adapted monitoring is non-inferior to extensive on-site monitoring. At most, extensive on-site monitoring could reduce the frequency of major Good Clinical Practice findings by 8.2% compared with risk-adapted monitoring. Conclusion: Compared with risk-adapted monitoring, the potential benefit of extensive on-site monitoring is small relative to overall finding rates, although risk- adapted monitoring requires less than 50% of extensive on-site monitoring resources. Clusters of findings within trials suggest that complicated, overly specific or not properly justified protocol requirements contributed to the overall frequency of findings. Risk- adapted monitoring in only a sample of patients appears sufficient to identify systematic problems in the conduct of clinical trials. Risk- adapted monitoring has a part to play in quality control. However, no monitoring strategy can remedy defects in quality of design. Monitoring should be embedded in a comprehensive quality management approach covering the entire trial lifecycle. ",no
Analgesics in Small Mammals. ,"Managing pain effectively in any species is challenging, but small mammals present particular problems. Methods of pain assessment are still under development in these species, so the efficacy of analgesic therapy cannot be evaluated fully. Methods of assessing abdominal pain are established; however, applying these can be challenging. Alternative methods, using assessment of facial expression, may be more applicable to a range of painful procedures and across species. Multimodal and preventive analgesic strategies are most likely to be effective. Although data on analgesic dose rates are limited, sufficient information is available to enable analgesia to be provided safely. ",no
Analgesic and acute inflammation properties of the aqueous extract of dried leaves of Paullinia pinnata (Sapindaceae) Linn. ,"Inflammation is frequently associated with pain. Plants continue to be major resources for therapeutic compounds against various diseases including inflammation and pain. Paullinia Pinnata is used to treat several diseases, including rheumatism and abdominal pain. This study was undertaken to assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of Paullinia Pinnata. The analgesic activity was evaluated by using behaviour pain model in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity was carried out by using carrageenan, dextran, histamine and serotonin induced inflammation in rat. The extract was administered orally at a dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg. The results showed that the extract significantly (P< 0.001) reduced the number of writhing induced by the acid acetic. The aqueous extract reduced significantly (P< 0.001) the paw licking time in formalin model. The effect of the extract (200mg/kg) was significantly (P< 0.001) reduced in the presence of naloxone, during the inflammatory phase. In addition, the extract significantly (P< 0.05) increase latency time at all point time and all doses on nociception induced by hot plate. Concerning inflammation induced by carrageenan and dextran, the extract significantly (P< 0.001) inhibited oedema during the experimental time at the dose of 200 mg/kg. The results suggested that Paullinia pinnata aqueous extract possess analgesic activities which may interfere in both peripheral and central pathway. The anti-inflammatory activities may be mediated by either inhibiting or by blocking the release of vasoactive substances like histamine, serotonin, kinins and prostaglandins. These results justify the traditional use of the plant in the treatment of pain and inflammation. ",no
Citizens Urge U.S. Food and Drug Administration to Restrict High-Potency Opioids. ," group of physicians and public health officials has petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to ban ultra-high dosage unit (UHDU) opioid medications from the market. UHDU opioids are those for which the prescribed usage exceeds the daily safe maximum set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 90 morphine milligram equivalents. For example, the authors cite the OxyContin 80-mg tablet: a single pill contains 120 morphine milligram equivalents, surpassing the Centers for Disease Control limit with a single dose.
This petition comes in the third decade of an opioid epidemic that has claimed thousands of American lives, a toll attributed to both the use of illicit heroin and legally obtained prescription medications. Although Americans comprise only 4.6% of the global population, they consume an estimated 80% of opioids produced worldwide.5 The death rate from opioid overdose in the United States has tripled since the 1990s, reaching almost 30,000 in 2014 alone—two thirds of all drug overdose deaths. Beyond mortality, a recent analysis concluded that one fifth of the current decline in U.S. men's unemployment could be attributed to opioid use.
As physicians, we are too familiar with the modern opioid crisis and its associated costs in lives and productivity. But how can we as neurosurgeons address these complex issues? The first and easiest step is to self-regulate the prescription of opioids, both postoperatively and in the clinic. We believe that neurosurgeons appreciate the proper use of opioids not as an answer for back pain but rather a temporary solution. These drugs should be used acutely, judiciously, and sparingly during postoperative recovery and follow-up. While back pain is reported by a majority of chronic opioid users, these drugs have poor long-term efficacy and do not appear to improve functional outcomes or accelerate return to work. Postoperative management in these patients can be a particular challenge, as their analgesic requirements are often extremely high, increasing the risk of adverse effects owing to the narrow therapeutic index of these drugs. Given these considerations, other tools would seem ideal to effectively treat these patients without exposure to the risks associated with UHDU opioid use.
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is one such method. Originally developed in Europe for abdominal surgery, ERAS is a multidisciplinary approach that aims to minimize the postoperative length of stay by accelerating the recovery process. This is accomplished by restructuring perioperative care around an integrated multidisciplinary team, reducing surgical trauma by adopting minimally invasive techniques, and combating metabolic stress associated with surgery. One key intervention in the ERAS system is a reduced prescription of intraoperative and postoperative opioid analgesics, especially high-potency systemic opioids. Incorporating multimodal analgesia and including long-acting anesthetics administered locally to the surgical site has been shown to reduce the need for systemic opioid use. 
We recently published our pilot ERAS protocol for lumbar spinal fusion. Spinal neurosurgery is an ideal field in which to establish ERAS programs, given the growing number of spine procedures in a population of increasingly frail patients, and the continued development of minimally invasive surgical approaches to the spine. But with these technical innovations, we must not neglect similar advances in postoperative analgesia.
The relationship between spine surgery and postoperative opioid use is becoming increasingly understood. Certain opioid-naïve patients seem to avoid long-term opioid use after lumbar surgery, while an appreciable number of patients who had used opioids before lumbar surgery continue to receive them 1 year after surgery. In our protocol, intraoperative opioids are avoided and postoperative opioids are minimized. Long-acting bupivacaine is administered locally to incision entry sites. In addition to short-term low-dose tramadol and acetaminophen, our postoperative analgesia approach includes gabapentin, which has been shown to effectively reduce pain and morphine consumption following spine surgery.
In today's landscape of political and social turmoil, the problem of opioid misuse lies squarely at the intersection of medicine, government, and industry. A dilemma of this magnitude will, then, require a solution of commensurate breadth and refinement. In the face of such a challenge, physicians of all specialties must take whatever measures are available within their field, rather than wait and react to new policy. We as neurosurgeons must consider the role of high-potency opioids in our own scope of practice. ERAS is one approach that offers a reduced need for opioid use in spine surgery, among many other benefits. By whatever means, we must take steps to diminish the use of high-potency opioids and the associated risk to our patients.",yes
